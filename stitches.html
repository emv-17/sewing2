                <li>OR tie knot as usual at the end of the thread, doubling for strength and width</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>start at the back, bring needle through the fabric to come out the front</li>
        <li>bring needle from the front, through fabric again, to the back</li>
    </ul>
